# Project Context (Fitness AI App)
You are building a fitness app with AI-generated, personalized training plans. The stack includes Fastify + gRPC (BE), React Native (mobile), React (web), PostgreSQL with Prisma, and OpenAI APIs.

# Core Principles
- TypeScript everywhere, no `any`
- Use Fastify for API with gRPC endpoints
- All AI logic is handled by backend calls to OpenAI
- Plan updates are made only via `updateTrainingPlan()`
- Feedback flow: `submitSessionFeedback()` → AI Agent → Suggestion
- Training plans are progressive and adaptive, not static
